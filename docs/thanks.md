# Thanks

As part of the open source release of amqpprox, we've squashed the repository
history to remove proprietary content from the git logs. In doing so, we risk
losing the recognition of those who contributed to bringing amqpprox to daily
production use in Bloomberg. We want to thank all of those who contributed
(in alphabetical order):

- [Adam Casey](https://github.com/adamncasey)
- [Alaric Nightingale](https://github.com/alaric)
- Alex Barley
- Andrey Zherikov
- Andriy Pastoshchuk
- [Chinmay Patel](https://github.com/Chinmay1412)
- Chris Cotter
- Gabriel Radu
- Jordan DeGea
- Juan Alday
- [Ojars Ratnieks](https://github.com/kumurs)
- [Paul Lampert](https://github.com/lampert)
- Peter Murfitt
- Thomas Gummerer
- Valentina Manea
- [Will Hoy](https://github.com/willhoy)

We also received a lot of review and help in readying this release, and we'd
like to thank our reviewers:
